# Multiple Partial Refunds Implementation - Update Summary

## 🎯 **Enhancement Overview**

Updated the refund system to support **multiple partial refunds** on the same bill, allowing users to continue refunding items until everything has been refunded.

## ✅ **What Was Changed**

### **🔄 Previous Limitation**
- ❌ After first partial refund, bill status became `partially_refunded`
- ❌ Refund button disappeared (only showed for `active` bills)
- ❌ No way to continue refunding remaining items
- ❌ Users had to manually edit bills to process additional refunds

### **🚀 Enhanced Functionality**
- ✅ Refund button now shows for both `active` AND `partially_refunded` bills
- ✅ New "Continue Refund" button text for partially refunded bills
- ✅ Track remaining refundable quantities per item
- ✅ Show refund history and remaining amounts
- ✅ Validate against remaining quantities (not original quantities)
- ✅ Support unlimited partial refunds until bill is fully refunded

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Changes (`index.js`)**

#### **1. New Endpoint: GET /bills/:id/refund-details**
```javascript
// Returns:
{
  bill: {
    ...bill_data,
    items: [
      {
        ...item_data,
        total_refunded: 2,        // Previously refunded quantity
        remaining_quantity: 3,    // Still available for refund
        can_refund: true          // Whether item can be refunded
      }
    ]
  },
  refund_history: [...],           // All previous refunds
  total_refunded_amount: 150.00,   // Total amount already refunded
  remaining_refund_amount: 350.00, // Amount still available for refund
  can_continue_refund: true        // Whether more refunds are possible
}
```

#### **2. Enhanced Refund Validation**
- **Before**: Validated against original bill quantities
- **After**: Validates against remaining quantities after previous refunds
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically marks bill as fully refunded when all items are refunded

#### **3. Remaining Quantity Calculation**
```sql
-- Gets total refunded per item across all previous refunds
SELECT bri.part_id, SUM(bri.quantity) as total_refunded
FROM bill_refunds br
JOIN bill_refund_items bri ON br.id = bri.refund_id
WHERE br.bill_id = $1
GROUP BY bri.part_id
```

### **Frontend Changes (`Sales.js`)**

#### **1. Enhanced Refund Button**
```javascript
// Shows for both active and partially refunded bills
{(bill.status === 'active' || bill.status === 'partially_refunded') && (
  <button className="btn btn-danger btn-sm" onClick={() => handleRefund(bill)}>
    {bill.status === 'partially_refunded' ? 'Continue Refund' : 'Refund'}
  </button>
)}
```

#### **2. Refund Details Loading**
- Fetches remaining quantities before showing refund modal
- Shows error if bill is fully refunded
- Initializes form with remaining quantities only

#### **3. Enhanced Refund Modal**
- **Refund History Section**: Shows previous refunds and remaining amounts
- **Quantity Columns**: Original → Refunded → Remaining → New Refund
- **Smart Validation**: Only allows refund up to remaining quantity
- **Disabled Items**: Items with no remaining quantity are disabled
- **Context-Aware Labels**: Different text for continuing vs initial refunds

## 📊 **User Experience Improvements**

### **Before**
```
Bill Status: Active
[Refund] → Process 2 items → Status: Partially Refunded
[No Refund Button] ❌ Stuck! Need to edit bill manually
```

### **After**
```
Bill Status: Active
[Refund] → Process 2 items → Status: Partially Refunded
[Continue Refund] → Process 1 more item → Status: Partially Refunded  
[Continue Refund] → Process last item → Status: Refunded ✅
```

### **Visual Enhancements**
1. **Status Indicators**: Color-coded badges for quantities
   - 🔵 Blue: Original quantity
   - 🟡 Yellow: Already refunded  
   - 🟢 Green: Available for refund
   - ⚪ Gray: Nothing left to refund

2. **Smart Form Behavior**
   - Disabled checkboxes for fully refunded items
   - Max quantity validation per remaining amounts
   - Real-time calculation of refund totals

3. **Contextual Information**
   - Shows refund history at top of modal
   - Explains continuing refund process
   - Clear indication of remaining vs. original amounts

## 🗄️ **Database Structure**

### **Existing Tables Enhanced**
- **`bills`**: Status tracking (active → partially_refunded → refunded)
- **`bill_refunds`**: Multiple refund records per bill
- **`bill_refund_items`**: Item-level refund tracking

### **Query Optimization**
- Indexed queries for refund history lookup
- Aggregated remaining quantity calculations
- Efficient validation against previous refunds

## 🔐 **Security & Validation**

### **Enhanced Validations**
1. **Quantity Validation**: Cannot refund more than remaining quantity
2. **Amount Validation**: Cannot exceed remaining refund amount  
3. **Status Validation**: Prevents refunds on fully refunded bills
4. **Item Validation**: Ensures refunded items exist in original bill
5. **User Authorization**: Only admin/superadmin can process refunds

### **Error Messages**
- `"Cannot refund X units of part Y, only Z units remain available for refund"`
- `"Part X has already been fully refunded"`
- `"This bill has been fully refunded and cannot be refunded further"`

## 📋 **Testing & Validation**

### **Test Scenarios Covered**
✅ **Multiple Partial Refunds**: Process 3 separate partial refunds on same bill  
✅ **Remaining Quantity Tracking**: Validate quantities decrease correctly  
✅ **Full Refund Detection**: Bill marked as refunded when all items processed  
✅ **Validation Errors**: Proper error handling for over-refunding
