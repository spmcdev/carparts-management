## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Changes (`index.js`)**

#### **1. Enhanced Bills Endpoint**
```javascript
// Now includes refund history in bills list
SELECT 
  b.*,
  json_agg(bill_items) as items,
  json_agg(refund_history) as refund_history  // NEW: Refund history
FROM bills b
LEFT JOIN bill_refunds br ON b.id = br.bill_id
LEFT JOIN users u ON br.refunded_by = u.id
```

#### **2. Calculated Refund Fields**
```javascript
// Added to each bill object:
{
  total_refunded: 150.00,        // Sum of all refunds
  remaining_amount: 350.00,      // Amount still owed/available
  refund_percentage: 30.0,       // Percentage refunded
  refund_history: [...]          // Complete refund history
}
```

#### **3. Comprehensive Refund History**
```javascript
// Each refund record includes:
{
  id: 1,
  refund_amount: 100.00,
  refund_reason: "Defective part",
  refund_type: "partial",
  refund_date: "2025-01-15",
