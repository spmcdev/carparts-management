# Edit Bill Dialog Search Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the Edit Bill dialog in the Sales interface to support searchable part selection instead of a simple dropdown. This improvement makes it much easier for users to find specific parts when adding items to bills.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added New State Variables
- `editBillPartSearchTerm`: Stores the current search text
- `showEditBillPartsList`: Controls visibility of the search results dropdown

### 2. Created Filter Function
- `filterEditBillParts()`: Filters available parts based on search criteria including:
  - Part name
  - Manufacturer
  - Part ID (exact match or starts with)
  - Part number
  - Parent ID (exact match or starts with)

### 3. Enhanced UI Components
Replaced the simple select dropdown with:
- **Search Input**: Text field with placeholder "Search parts by name, manufacturer, part number, or ID..."
- **Clear Button**: Quickly clear search and close dropdown
- **Search Results Dropdown**: 
  - Scrollable list (max height: 200px)
  - Rich display with part details, stock information, and badges
  - Click to select functionality
- **Quick Select Fallback**: Traditional dropdown for users who prefer it (limited to first 20 parts)

### 4. Search Result Display
Each search result shows:
- **Part Name** (bold)
- **Manufacturer, Part Number, Parent ID** (secondary text)
- **Color-coded badges**:
  - Green: Available Stock
  - Yellow: Reserved Stock
  - Red: Sold Stock
  - Blue: Part ID
  - Warning: Recommended Price

### 5. State Management
- **Auto-clear on selection**: Search clears when part is selected
- **Auto-clear on modal close**: Search resets when Edit Bill dialog is closed
- **Auto-clear on item add**: Search resets when new item is successfully added

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Faster Part Finding**: Users can quickly type part names, numbers, or IDs
2. **Visual Feedback**: Rich display with stock levels and pricing information
3. **Keyboard Friendly**: Type to search without mouse navigation
4. **Fallback Option**: Traditional dropdown still available for users who prefer it
5. **Consistent Styling**: Uses same CSS classes as reservation search for consistent look

## Technical Implementation
- Leverages existing `filterParts` function pattern for consistency
- Uses Bootstrap styling for seamless integration
- Follows React best practices for state management
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality

## Testing
- ESLint validation passed (no new errors)
- Syntax validation successful
- Follows existing code patterns from reservation search functionality

This enhancement significantly improves the user experience when editing bills, especially for users managing large inventories with hundreds or thousands of parts.
