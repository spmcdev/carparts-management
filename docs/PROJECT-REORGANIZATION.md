# Project Reorganization Summary

## Overview
The project has been reorganized to improve maintainability and code organization. All scattered files from the root directory have been moved to appropriate directories.

## Changes Made

### Files Moved to `tests/`
- All `test-*.js` files moved from root to `tests/`
- New subdirectories created:
  - `tests/debug/` - Debug and diagnostic scripts
  - `tests/staging/` - Staging-specific test scripts

### Files Moved to `scripts/`
- All `test-*.sh` shell scripts moved to `scripts/`
- All validation scripts (`validate-*.js`, `check-*.js`) moved to `scripts/`
- All `.cjs` CommonJS files moved to `scripts/`
- Existing subdirectories maintained:
  - `scripts/deployment/` - Deployment automation
  - `scripts/database/` - Database operations
  - `scripts/monitoring/` - Health checks

### Files Moved to `docs/`
- New `docs/summaries/` directory created for:
  - All `*SUMMARY*.md` files
  - Implementation summary JavaScript files (`*-summary.js`)
- Guide files (`*GUIDE*.md`) moved to `docs/`

### Files Moved to `archive/`
- New `archive/demos/` directory created for:
  - HTML demo files (`*.html`)

## Directory Structure

### Before Reorganization
Root directory contained 62+ files including scattered test files, debug scripts, documentation, and demo files.

### After Reorganization
Root directory now contains only essential project files:
- Core application files (`index.js`, `package.json`, etc.)
- Configuration files (`.env`, `docker-compose.yml`, etc.)
- Essential documentation (`README.md`)
- Organized directories (`docs/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`, `archive/`)

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Root Directory**: Essential files are easily visible
2. **Better Organization**: Related files are grouped together
3. **Easier Navigation**: Developers can quickly find specific types of files
4. **Improved Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns
5. **Better Documentation**: All summaries and guides are properly organized

## File Count Reduction in Root
- **Before**: 62+ files in root directory
- **After**: ~29 essential files in root directory
- **Files Organized**: 30+ files moved to appropriate directories

## Next Steps
- Consider creating additional subdirectories as needed
- Update any scripts that reference moved files
- Update CI/CD pipelines if they reference specific file paths
- Consider adding `.gitignore` patterns for temporary files to prevent future clutter
