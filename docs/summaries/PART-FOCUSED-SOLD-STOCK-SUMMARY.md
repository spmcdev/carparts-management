# Part-Focused Sold Stock Report Update

## Overview
Updated the sold stock report endpoints to focus on part-level summaries instead of bill-level details, removing customer information, bill details, and specific dates while providing comprehensive part sales analytics.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. `/sold-stock-report` Endpoint Changes

#### Removed Fields:
- Customer details (customer_name, customer_phone)
- Bill details (bill_id, bill_number, bill_date, bill_status, sold_by)
- Individual sale dates and transaction details

#### Added Fields:
- **Part-level aggregation**: Groups all sales by part_id
- **Sales summary metrics**:
  - `total_sold_quantity`: Total quantity sold across all transactions
  - `times_sold`: Number of separate transactions for this part
  - `average_selling_price`: Average price across all sales
  - `min_selling_price`: Lowest selling price
  - `max_selling_price`: Highest selling price
  - `total_revenue`: Total revenue generated by this part
  - `first_sale_date`: Date of first sale
  - `last_sale_date`: Date of most recent sale
  - `average_profit_margin_percent`: Average profit margin percentage
  - `total_profit`: Total profit generated (if cost_price available)

#### New Data Structure:
```json
{
  "sold_parts": [
    {
      "part_id": 123,
      "part_name": "Brake Pad Set",
      "manufacturer": "Bosch",
      "part_number": "BP-001",
      "container_no": "CTN-2024-001",
      "local_purchase": false,
      "cost_price": 50.00,
      "recommended_price": 80.00,
      "sales_summary": {
        "total_sold_quantity": 15,
        "times_sold": 8,
        "total_revenue": 1200.00,
        "average_selling_price": 80.00,
        "min_selling_price": 75.00,
        "max_selling_price": 85.00,
        "first_sale_date": "2024-01-15",
        "last_sale_date": "2024-12-30",
        "average_profit_margin_percent": 37.5,
        "total_profit": 450.00
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. `/sold-stock-summary` Endpoint Changes

#### Enhanced Summary Statistics:
- `unique_parts_sold`: Number of different parts sold
- `total_transactions`: Total number of sales transactions
- `total_quantity_sold`: Total quantity across all parts
- `estimated_profit`: Total estimated profit

#### Enhanced Top Selling Parts:
- Added part_id for reference
- Added cost_price and recommended_price
- Added min_price and max_price for each part
- Added avg_profit_margin_percent

### 3. Benefits of the New Structure

#### For Business Analysis:
- **Part Performance**: See which parts are top sellers by quantity and revenue
- **Pricing Analysis**: Compare min/max/average selling prices per part
- **Profit Analysis**: Calculate profit margins and total profit per part
- **Inventory Insights**: Understand sales frequency and patterns

#### For Reporting:
- **Cleaner Data**: Focused on what matters - part sales performance
- **Better Aggregation**: Summary statistics are more meaningful
- **Easier Analysis**: No need to manually group by parts in frontend
- **Privacy Compliant**: No customer data in part-focused reports

### 4. Maintained Features

#### Filtering Still Works:
- Container number filtering
- Local purchase vs container purchase filtering
- Date range filtering
- All existing filter combinations

#### Pagination:
- Still supports pagination
- Now counts unique parts instead of individual transactions
- More efficient for large datasets

### 5. SQL Query Improvements

#### Main Query Optimization:
```sql
-- Groups by part details and aggregates sales data
GROUP BY p.id, p.name, p.manufacturer, p.part_number, p.container_no, p.local_purchase, p.cost_price, p.recommended_price
ORDER BY total_sold_quantity DESC, total_revenue DESC
```

#### Performance Benefits:
- Reduced data transfer (fewer rows returned)
- More meaningful sorting (by sales volume/revenue)
- Better for analytics and business intelligence

## Usage Examples

### Get Part Sales Summary:
```bash
GET /sold-stock-report?local_purchase=false&from_date=2024-01-01&to_date=2024-12-31&page=1&limit=20
```

### Get Container Parts Only:
```bash
GET /sold-stock-report?container_no=CTN-2024-001
```

### Get Overall Summary:
```bash
GET /sold-stock-summary?from_date=2024-01-01&to_date=2024-12-31
```

## Migration Notes

### Frontend Updates Needed:
1. Update data structure parsing in sold stock components
2. Remove customer/bill detail displays
3. Add new part-level metrics displays
4. Update charts/graphs to use aggregated data

### API Response Changes:
- `sold_stock` array renamed to `sold_parts`
- Individual transaction data removed
- Part sales summary data added
- Enhanced summary statistics

### Backward Compatibility:
- Filter parameters remain the same
- Pagination structure unchanged
- Response format is different but more comprehensive

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Aggregation**: Verify totals match between old and new formats
2. **Test Filtering**: Ensure all filter combinations work correctly
3. **Test Performance**: Check query performance with large datasets
4. **Test Edge Cases**: Empty results, single transactions, etc.

This update transforms the sold stock report from a transaction-focused view to a strategic part performance analysis tool, providing better insights for inventory management and business decisions.
